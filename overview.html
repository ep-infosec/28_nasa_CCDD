The Core Flight System (CFS) Command and Data Dictionary (<b>CCDD</b>) utility is a software tool for managing the command and telemetry data for CFS and CFS applications.  <b>CCDD</b> is written in Java&trade; and interacts with a PostgreSQL database, so it can be used on any operating system that supports the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and PostgreSQL.  <b>CCDD</b> is released as open source software under the NASA Open Source Software Agreement, version 1.3, and is hosted on GitHub.
<br><br>
The <b>CCDD</b> application uses tables, similar to a spreadsheet, to display and allow manipulation of telemetry data structures, command information, and other data pertinent to a CFS project.  The data is stored in a PostgreSQL database for manipulation and data security.  The PostgreSQL database server can be run locally or centralized on a remote host for easier access by multiple users.  Data can be imported into the application from files in comma-separated values (CSV), JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), electronic data sheet (EDS), and extensible markup language (XML) telemetric and command exchange (XTCE) formats.  Data can be exported from the application to files in CSV, JSON, EDS, and XTCE formats.  The <b>CCDD</b> tables also allow simple cut and paste operations from the host operating system's clipboard.  To make use of the project's data, <b>CCDD</b> can interact with Java Virtual Machine (JVM)-based scripting languages via a set of supplied data access methods.  Using scripts, the user can translate the data stored in the <b>CCDD</b>'s database into output files.  Example scripts for creating common CFS related output files are provided in four of these scripting languages.  An embedded web server can be activated, allowing web-based application access to the data.

See the <b>CCDD</b> users guide for details on set up and use.
