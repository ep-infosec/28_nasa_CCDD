*** C structure to CSV conversion utility ***

c_struct_to_csv_convert is a Java application that converts C-language structures into the comma
separated values (CSV) format used for importing tables into the CFS Command & Data Dictionary
(CCDD) program.  The utility scans the specified file(s) for "struct" and "typedef struct" 
definitions. Any other content in the file(s) is ignored.  Comments associated with the structures
or variables is preserved in the CSV file.

Macro values or formulae for a variable's array size or bit length are converted to CCDD macros.
However, the value of these macros is set to "2" - the user may edit the CSV file to update the
macro values (or edit them in CCDD after importing).  Note that the default macro value can lead to
import errors if a macro formula used as an array size evaluates to less that 2 (array size
must be >= 2).

The application reads the input and output file information from a file, "conversion_paths", which
must be located in the same folder as the executable.  The format for each entry in the file is as
follows:

  short name, type, output file path+name, input file path+name [, input file path+name 2 [, ...]]
  
"short name" and "type" are descriptive text used to create a comment in the output file. For
example, if the input file is a cFS application then the short name would be the application's name
("CI", "HK", etc.) and the type would be "cFS application".  "output file path+name" is the name
of the output file, including its folder path (without a path the file is written to the folder
from which the application is executed).  "input file path+name" is the name of the input file from
which to extract the structure definitions, including its folder path (without a path the file is
sought in the folder from which the application is executed).  Multiple input files may be
specified, separated by commas - all of the structures from these files are written to the single
output file.

Rows in the conversion_paths file that are blank, or that begin with the "#" character are ignored.

To perform the conversion execute the following:

  java -jar c_struct_to_csv_convert.jar [-output <output folder path>]
  
The -output option, if used, prepends the supplied folder path to each output file in the
conversion_paths file.  Note that this retains any path already specified for the output file.
